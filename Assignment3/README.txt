Problems

    Create an Android application, which displays a registration form in both portrait and landscape mode. The registration form should consist of necessary labels and text fields for first name, last name, birthday, address, email address and phone number. Choose appropriate input types for the text fields. In the landscape mode the registration form should provide vertical scrollbars, but in the portrait mode the whole form should be displayed in one single window. Make sure that if the screen orientation is changed while filling the registration form, already existing data in the text fields will no be lost.
    Improve the previous application so that each time the screen orientation changes, the current date and time will be saved to a variable and then restored and displayed on a TextView on the activity.
    Modify the previous application so that you determine the orientation of the activity as landscape in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
    Modify the previous application so that you determine the orientation of the activity as portrait programmatically.
